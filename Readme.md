# ST Asset Tacking

This repository contains the ST Asset Tracking app source code.

With the ST Asset Tracking app, you can configure and set-up the threshold of Asset Tracking Bluetooth Low Energy device and NFC Sensor.
The app communicates with the [FP-ATR-BLE1](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/fp-atr-ble1.html), [FP-SNS-SMARTAG1](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/fp-sns-smartag1.html), [FP-SNS-SMARTAG2](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/fp-sns-smartag2.html), [FP-ATR-ASTRA1](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/fp-atr-astra1.html) functional packs firmware running on an STM32 microcontroller, which manages the specific environmental and motion sensor data logging activity. The app also supports [Astra](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/steval-astra1b.html) board that has NFC and short / long range connectivity (BLE, LoRa, and 2.4 GHz and sub 1-GHz proprietary protocols).

The app lets you change sampling intervals, choose which sensor data is logged, and the conditions that trigger data logging.
Once configured, the app is starting to track the position, environmental and motion sensors and allows the user to send recorded data to the ST AWS dashboard.
The data collected on dashboard can be consulted through charts and filtered through time intervals up to 7 days before.
